                                I picked up this jacket for use in San Francisco and the surrounding Bat Area (Lake Tahoe included).
                                I use this jacket for everything. It is often cloudy/drizzly/cold in SF and this jacket deals
                                with it all. I have not tried in heavy rain, but in drizzly conditions, the DWR treatment definitely
                                makes small drops bead right off. It also has a nice

                                Loved this jacket so much from previous years I decided to buy a second in a different color.
                                I'm tall and fairly slender and it's tailored silhouette fits me nicely. For perspective I'm around
                                6'3" -150lbs, and a large does the trick. I'll wear this for all of fall and into the winter.
                                Despite not being bulky or buggy I find it good and warm for anything down to 40 degrees and
                                perhaos lower if you're keeping up on your layering. For weather at freezing or below you should
                                consider something heavier.
